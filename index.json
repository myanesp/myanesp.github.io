My background comes from social sciences, but now I\u0026rsquo;m specialized in data science thanks to a master degree in Computational Social Sciences.\nMy main programming languages are R, Python and SQL, and I\u0026rsquo;m interested in any open source projects related to data science, but also data sovereignty and digital rights.\nI\u0026rsquo;m actually working as a Data scientist at LEMI, a research group in Library Science at Carlos III University (Madrid). I\u0026rsquo;m also in charge of the administration of the Linux-powered server we have to work with.\nIn my free time, I also tinker with stuff with R, like building a redirect checker (called Redirect CheckR; hard name, uh 游땔) and other projects you can see in the proper section.\nI also host many services at home and maintain some containers. All the files and configurations are available in my GitHub Repository.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio","summary":"Hi there!","title":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"privacy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/r/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"r"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/shiny/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"shiny"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"There are public portals like WhereGoes where you introduce a link and they show you all the hopes the request does. Normally, because the URL is shortened, the original link is not secure (http) or it has trackers in between.\nThe idea and the development is easy: use the request R package and visualize the information with shiny.\nSo from that born Redirect CheckeR. It can be use in several ways.\nView with a Shiny webpage, locally from any IDE #Download the app.R file from the repository and execute the R script. Then access to localhost:3838 and play!\nDeploying as a Docker container, to access anywhere #Clone the repository, edit the ports if needed in docker-compose.yml, and deploy with docker compose up -d or using your container manager like Portainer. Then access to the IP of the host you\u0026rsquo;re running this container at + the port you\u0026rsquo;ve mapped, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go!\nUsing it as a function, displaying the output in the terminal (not available yet) # remotes::install.github(\u0026#34;myanesp/redirect-checkR\u0026#34;) library(redirect-checkR) url \u0026lt;- http://google.es get_redirections(url) ","date":"1 February 2024","permalink":"/post/2024-02-07-unwrapping-link-s-redirection-with-r-and-shiny/","section":"Posts","summary":"There are public portals like WhereGoes where you introduce a link and they show you all the hopes the request does.","title":"Unwrapping link's redirection with R and Shiny"},{"content":"Listed in this page you can find the different projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, ones are mantained (or in progress) 游릭, and other(s) the development may stop or is stopped 游댮.\n游릭 tmdbR. R package (developed w/ Isabela Zeberio) designed to interact with the TMDB API directly from R, with some tools just to scrap data and other to transform/manipulate it.\nAlthough we keep mantaining this package, we did for our Master, so you can see some cool visualizations we did with the data here.\n游릭 Redirect CheckR. Simple R package for checking all the redirections a URL request makes. Useful for unshorten short links, avoid intermedium trackers or debug. Blog post\n游릭 pkgcsv. Tiny R package for export and import your R packages from one installation to another using .csv files. Pretty few options for now, but I will try to add more features.\n游댮 Cercan칤as Madrid Dashboard. This is a Shiny Dashboard that shows the incidents (delays, cancellations, etc.) from the public railway transportation of the Community of Madrid, from 2015 to June 2023 (when Elon Musk shutdown the possibility of obtaining data for free with the Twitter API). This was my Master\u0026rsquo;s final project, and the source code is stored here.\nFor this project, I scrapped data with the official API and with snscrape (an unofficial Python library), and then I used R for cleaning it and visualised it with Shiny. With a custom Docker image, I encapsulated the whole process of scrapping, cleaning and visualisation in a container that updated the info every day at 3am.\nAnd more coming soon!\n","date":"26 January 2024","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio","summary":"Listed in this page you can find the different projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, ones are mantained (or in progress) 游릭, and other(s) the development may stop or is stopped 游댮.","title":"Projects"}]
