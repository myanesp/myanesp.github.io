My background comes from social sciences, but now I\u0026rsquo;m specialized in data science thanks to a master degree in Computational Social Sciences.\nMy main programming languages are R, Python and SQL, and I\u0026rsquo;m interested in any open source projects related to data science, but also data sovereignty and digital rights.\nI\u0026rsquo;m actually working as a Data scientist at LEMI, a research group in Library Science at Carlos III University (Madrid). I\u0026rsquo;m also in charge of the administration of the Linux-powered server we have to work with.\nIn my free time, I also tinker with stuff with R, like building a redirect checker (called Redirect CheckR; hard name, uh 游땔) and other projects you can see in the proper section.\nI also host many services at home and maintain some containers. All the files and configurations are available in my GitHub Repository.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio","summary":"Hi there!","title":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Some weeks ago, a colleague of mine asked me if I knew any R package to translate some dataframes she wanted to have in different languages. We knew some packages written in Python, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t see any for R that were suitable for her project. So I dept into this topic and I ended with two R packages: the one for today using LibreTranslate, that allows us to translate strings even without Internet connection, and other one that uses opensource frontends for common translations engines.\nFirst things first: why LibreTranslate? #LibreTranslate is one amazing piece of free and open source software. As stated on their GitHub repository, \u0026ldquo;unlike other APIs, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on proprietary providers such as Google or Azure to perform translations. Instead, its translation engine is powered by the open source Argos Translate library\u0026rdquo;. Besides this advantages (from a privacy and ethical point of view), it also allows the user to translate from its own computer or server without the need of Internet connection, because when you install LibreTranslate, it downloads all the models for the languages to your machine.\nimage\n","date":"15 April 2024","permalink":"/post/2024-04-15-translate-with-r-i-libretranslater-for-offline-translations/","section":"Posts","summary":"Some weeks ago, a colleague of mine asked me if I knew any R package to translate some dataframes she wanted to have in different languages.","title":"Translate with R (I): libretranslateR for offline translations"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/debug/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"debug"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/docker/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"docker"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/link/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"link"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"privacy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/r/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"r"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/shiny/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"shiny"},{"content":"There are public portals like WhereGoes where you introduce a link and they show you all the hopes the request does. Normally, because the URL is shortened, the original link is not secure (http) or it has trackers in between.\nThe idea and the development is easy: use the request R package and visualize the information with shiny.\nSo from that born Redirect CheckeR. It can be use in several ways.\nView with a Shiny webpage, locally from any IDE #Download the app.R file from the repository and execute the R script. Then access to localhost:3838 and play!\nDeploying as a Docker container, to access anywhere #Clone the repository, edit the ports if needed in docker-compose.yml, and deploy with docker compose up -d or using your container manager like Portainer.

R package (developed w/ Isabela Zeberio) designed to interact with the TMDB API directly from R, with some tools just to scrap data and other to transform/manipulate it.\nAlthough we keep mantaining this package, we did for our Master, so you can see some cool visualizations we did with the data here.\n游릭 libretranslateR. R bind to LibreTranslate API: translate, detect languages, obtain the available languages to translate from and to. You can even selfhost a LibreTranslate server and do your translations offline!\n游릭 opentranslatr. Translate in R using opensource frontends for common translations engines such as Google Translate.\n游릭 Redirect CheckR. Simple R package for checking all the redirections a URL request makes. Useful for unshorten short links, avoid intermedium trackers or debug. Blog post\n游릭 pkgcsv. Tiny R package for export and import your R packages from one installation to another using .csv files. Pretty few options for now, but I will try to add more features.\n游댮 Cercan칤as Madrid Dashboard. This is a Shiny Dashboard that shows the incidents (delays, cancellations, etc.) from the public railway transportation of the Community of Madrid, from 2015 to June 2023 (when Elon Musk shutdown the possibility of obtaining data for free with the Twitter API). This was my Master\u0026rsquo;s final project, and the source code is stored here.\nFor this project, I scrapped data with the official API and with snscrape (an unofficial Python library), and then I used R for cleaning it and visualised it with Shiny. With a custom Docker image, I encapsulated the whole process of scrapping, cleaning and visualisation in a container that updated the info every day at 3am.\nAnd more coming soon!\n","date":"26 January 2024","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Mario Yanes' Portfolio","summary":"Listed in this page you can find the different projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, ones are mantained (or in progress) 游릭, and other(s) the development may stop or is stopped 游댮.","title":"Projects"}]
